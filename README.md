# User Registration System

## Description

Develop a simple user registration system using Rust. The system should allow users to create an account by providing their name and age. The program should validate the user's age, store the user's information, and display a confirmation message upon successful registration.

Requirements:

- Prompt the user to enter their name and age.
- Validate the age input to ensure it is a valid number.
- If the age is valid, store the user's information in a persistent data structure (e.g., a file or a database). 
- Display a confirmation message with the user's name upon successful registration.
