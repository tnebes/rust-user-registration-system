# User Registration System

## Description

The goal is to develop a simple user registration system using Rust. The system should allow users to create an account by providing their name and age. The program should validate the user's age, store the user's information, and display a confirmation message upon successful registration.

Requirements:

- Prompt the user to enter their name and age.
- Validate the age input to ensure it is a valid number.
- If the age is valid, store the user's information in a persistent data structure i.e. a file.
- - Display a confirmation message with the user's name upon successful registration.
- Add a logger that logs system events to a file.
- Add i18n support to the system.
- Add unit tests to the system.
